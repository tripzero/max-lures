# RFDuino Minnowboard Max Lure

This lure adds Bluetooth Low Energy capabilities to the Minnowboard Max.  Communication 
with the rfduino happens through the UART2 on the Max and GPIO_0 and GPIO_1 on the 
RFDuino.  Protocol is TBD.  This lure allows for the following features:

* Bluetooth Low Energy Support
* 5 GPIO with SPI and I2C
* Programmable with Arduino IDE 1.6+
* Should be compatible with some RFDuino shields
